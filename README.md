## **Requirements**  
Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## **Workflow**  
1. Data Loading: Import and explore the dataset.  
2. Visualization: Analyze data distribution and correlations.  
3. Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.  
4. Modeling: Train a Random Forest Regressor on the data.  
5. Evaluation: Assess model performance using MSE and RÂ².  
6. Prediction: Predict sales for test samples.
